# Prototype_Feedback
version of my prototype from my exam to gather feedback

To get the prototype to work, you must have python installed with the libraries flask(Flask, render_template, request and session) and sqlite3 as the prototype uses those. If you are unsure how to download these libraries, use the gift box icon on visual studio and a search bar that says "search PyPi and install packages" should appear on the right hand side of your visual studio. search up each individual module needed (sqlite3, flask, Flask, render_template, request and session) and click the prompted command "pip install [inputted search]" that appears below the search for each one.
The prototype was only ever tested on microsoft edge so if it does not work on other browsers your best bet will be to use microsoft edge.
To run the prototype, run the python file and it will output "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000". Copy the link into your browser and the prototype should run in your browser. However, if that does not work copy the link from here and try again.
