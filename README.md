# Prototype_Feedback
version of my prototype from my exam to gather feedback

To get the prototype to work, you must have python installed with the libraries flask and sqlite3 as the prototype uses those. 
The prototype was only ever tested on microsoft edge so if it does not work on other browsers your best bet will be to use microsoft edge.
To run the prototype, run the python file and it will output "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000". try running the prototype with what outputs for you. However, if that does not work copy the link from here and try again.
